# Multi-Source Candidate Transformer

## Overview

The **Multi-Source Candidate Transformer** is a modular data processing pipeline that consolidates candidate information from multiple sources into a single, standardized candidate profile.

The system accepts data from:

* ATS (Applicant Tracking System)
* Resume (PDF)
* Recruiter Notes (Text)

It normalizes, merges, validates, scores, and projects the information into a unified JSON output.

# Pipeline Workflow

### Step 1 – Parse Inputs

The pipeline reads data from:

* ATS JSON
* Resume PDF
* Recruiter Notes

Each source is parsed independently.

---

### Step 2 – Normalize

The extracted information is converted into a common schema.

Examples include:

* Standardized phone numbers
* Lowercase emails
* Duplicate removal
* Consistent field names

---

### Step 3 – Merge

Candidate information from all sources is merged using configurable source priorities.

Example priority:

```
ATS > Resume > Recruiter Notes
```

---

### Step 4 – Confidence Calculation

A confidence score is calculated based on field completeness and availability.

Example:

```
Overall Confidence = 1.0
```

---

### Step 5 – Validation

Mandatory fields are validated before generating the final output.

Validation checks include:

* Candidate ID
* Name
* Email
* Phone Number
* Skills

---

### Step 6 – Projection

The merged candidate is transformed into the required output schema.

---

# Technologies Used

* Python 3
* pdfplumber
* Regular Expressions (Regex)
* JSON
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

# Input Files

### ATS

```
input/ats.json
```

### Resume

```
input/resume.pdf
```

### Recruiter Notes

```
input/recruiter_notes.txt
```

---

# Output

```
output/final_candidate.json
```

Example:

```json
{
  "candidate_id": "C001",
  "full_name": "RAM PRABHA M",
  "emails": [
    "prabhaidol@gmail.com"
  ],
  "phones": [
    "8838758349"
  ],
  "headline": "AI/ML & Full Stack Developer",
  "experience": [
    {
      "company": "Software Solution",
      "role": "Full Stack Developer Intern",
      "years": 1
    }
  ],
  "skills": [
    "Python",
    "Java",
    "SQL",
    "Machine Learning"
  ],
  "overall_confidence": 1.0
}
